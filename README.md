# MyReads Project

This is a Book Shelf Application that you could search and organize books in your shelves (_currently reading_, _want to read_ and _read_)

# Quickstart

## Install

Clone the GitHub repository, install the dependencies and start the server:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eduatletico/NdgReact-p1-my-reads
$ cd NdgReact-p1-my-reads
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the search, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the final version code for _everyone_. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
